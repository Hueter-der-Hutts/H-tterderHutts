Hey, if you wondering I'm german so a few expressions are german or bad english xD.


How to use it?
1. calculate.py it will use your input and try to calculate the result (it's every time 5).
2.new_try.py will now use different input's and calculate them again
3. after that in the 1.txt are the different weights/bias/how accurate they were
4. bestesfinden.py for english "find the best" it takes 1.txt and writes down the best try's
    (lowest is best but it write down more than one, and its a bit complicated written down 
    it's "[how much percent away from the result] w(weight)[weight] b(bias)[Bias]
